1.2 - Nov 1 2001
Danny Bogaards noticed two improvements in wt_edit:
- usage of ENV{REMOTE_USER}
- CGI URL was hard coded; is now variable-ized

1.1 - Oct 24 2001
- Fixed small bug in wt_edit (priority check used $perc instead
  of $pri).
- Added code in wt_edit to log any changes to perc or pri (in case
  there's no change to the desc).
- Added a line to wt_display to say how many entries are displayed
