1.3 - Nov 3 2001
- changed tmpfile naming in utilities.pl -- some people make /tmp
  a separate partition, so rename() barfs; simplified to just be the
  TODO_FILE + pid (thanks again Danny)
- if remote_user not set, use 'someone at REMOTE_IP'
- renamed wt*.cgi to wt*.pl (use commit -r x.y to keep revisions sane)
TODO
- doc: rewrite in LaTeX, consolidate and simplify - keep in mind two
  classes of people:
	1) get it up and working quickly (provide QUICK INSTALL steps)
	2) readers (provide pointer to GUIDE)
	- have a README.1st file with "hello", QUICK INSTALL, and pointer to GUIDE
- doc: strongly suggest ACL usage in order to populate $who
- doc: requires Text::CSV module which might not be installed (howto install)

1.2 - Nov 1 2001
Danny Bogaards noticed two improvements in wt_edit:
- usage of ENV{REMOTE_USER}
- CGI URL was hard coded; is now variable-ized

1.1 - Oct 24 2001
- Fixed small bug in wt_edit (priority check used $perc instead
  of $pri).
- Added code in wt_edit to log any changes to perc or pri (in case
  there's no change to the desc).
- Added a line to wt_display to say how many entries are displayed
