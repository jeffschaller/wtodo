Wtodo is a CGI program that I use to keep track of my work projects.
It has no bells or whistles, but it gets the job done. If you like it,
send me a note!

This README file explains how to install wtodo; for a more general 
overview, read the wtodo guide in the docs directory.

Thanks for taking a look at wtodo!

WARNING

I strongly recommend putting this on a private web server along with an ACL; I
personally would not use this on a public web server, as the web server userid
has to have permission to write to your "todos" file. See the guide for more
discussion about security concerns.

INSTALLATION OVERVIEW

These perl modules depend on one additional perl module that may not come
standard with your distribution: Text::CSV. You can install it with the CPAN
module: perl -MCPAN -e shell; cpan> install Text::CSV
or manually from http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/ALANCITT/Text-CSV-0.01.tar.gz
or by searching CPAN -- http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Text::CSV

1. move the program files into a cgi-bin directory
2. pick a filename for the todo file
3. make one edit
4. done!

INSTALLATION STEPS

I've included some example commands within the instructions; they assume that you're 
installing into a directory that's named by an environment variable called CGI -- 
this way you can set the variable (see immediately below) and then copy and paste 
the sample commands as a pseudo script -- just make the appropriate changes!

CGI=/home/schaller/public_html/cgi-bin
export CGI

1. (Suggested) Create a "wtodo" subdirectory under your cgi-bin directory.
	eg. mkdir $CGI/wtodo
2. (Suggested) Create a "wtodo/data" subdirectory (could be under cgi-bin or /home)
	to store the todo entries.
	eg. mkdir $CGI/wtodo/data
3. (Suggested) Create an ACL on the $CGI/wtodo directory
4. (Required) Edit utilities.pl and enter a filename for your "todos" file.
	** The program will not work until you've done the above! **
	eg. TODO_FILE=$CGI/data/todo.csv
	(Suggested) Use the wtodo/data subdirectory you created above, and use an
	extension of "csv" as a reminder that it is a comma-separated file.
5. (Required) Copy utilities.pl, wt_display.cgi, and wt_edit.cgi into the wtodo
   cgi-bin directory you created above.
	eg. cp utilities.pl wt_display.cgi wt_edit.cgi $CGI/wtodo
6. (Suggested) Ensure that wt_display.cgi and wt_edit.cgi are marked executable for
   "other". The files within the distribution should already be executable.
	eg. chmod o+x wt_display.cgi wt_edit.cgi
7. (Suggested!) Start using it! 
	eg. surf to $CGI_URL/wt_display.cgi
