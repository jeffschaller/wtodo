Wtodo is a CGI program that I use to keep track of my work projects.
It has no bells or whistles, but it gets the job done. If you like it,
send me a note!

INSTALLATION
I suggest putting this on a private web server along with an ACL; I
would not use this on a public web server, as the web server userid
has to have permission to write to your "todos" file. I've included
some example commands that assume you're installing into a directory
that's named by an environment variable called CGI -- this lets you
copy and paste these instructions as a pseudo script ... just make the
appropriate changes!

export CGI=/home/schaller/cgi-bin

1. Create a "wtodo" subdirectory under your cgi-bin directory.
	eg. mkdir $CGI/wtodo
2. Create a "wtodo/data" subdirectory (could be under cgi-bin or /home).
	eg. mkdir $CGI/wtodo/data
3. Optionally create an ACL on $CGI/wtodo
4. Edit utilities.pl and pick a filename for your "todos" file.
	** The program will not work until you've done the above steps **
	eg. TODO_FILE=$CGI/data/todo.csv
5. Copy utilities.pl, wt_display.cgi, and wt_edit.cgi into the wtodo
   subdirectory under cgi-bin.
	eg. cp utilities.pl wt_display.cgi wt_edit.cgi $CGI/wtodo
6. Ensure that wt_display.cgi and wt_edit.cgi are marked executable for
   "other".
	eg. chmod o+x wt_display.cgi wt_edit.cgi
7. Start using it! 
	eg. http://localhost/your/cgi-bin/wtodo/wt_display.cgi
