Overview</A>
</H1>
	This program is a set of CGI scripts written in perl. The first
program, wt_display, has: a form for adding new entries, a table of
options to filter the display of entries, and finally a table listing
the entries. The second program, wt_edit, allows updates to an entry. 
A third file, utilities.pl, contains subroutines that are common to the
two scripts.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02000000000000000000">
History and Background</A>
</H1>
	I had written a command-line program called 'jtodo' in order to
manage my tasks. I gave thought at that time to making a web-based version, but lacked
sufficient motivation. When another person joined my team at work, it
became necessary to consolidate some of our tasks.  Being a web-oriented team, 
I resurrected my original plans and created the program.

<P>
Revisionist history: it turns out that having a title of ``Jeff's
Awesome Web-based Program'' has had some sort of inhibitory effect on the
team's usage of the program, so it's turned out that I'm the only one
actually using it - oh well :) I have been using it daily (in its original form)
for almost an entire year. Now that the program is hosted on Sourceforge.net,
I've had suggestions for improvements, which I greatly appreciate!

<P>
My original concerns revolved around security.  Web-based applications have
two huge problems here: authentication of users and protection of data. I
recommend putting an ACL on the directory which contains the CGI scripts 
to "solve" the authentication problem.  As far as protection of the data: the program has
a small number of known users; several of the fields have maximum-length
restraints; and the parts of the program which read and write the datafile
use advisory locking (the best that can be done). Both scripts use perl's 
``-w'' flag (which warns about possible errors) as well as the ``use strict''
command, which imports more safety restrictions on variable and subroutine usage.
Additionally, the most damage that can be done from within the program is
to add bogus description entries or to change the percent-complete
or priority fields around. The program logs all of these changes, so it would
be easy to (manually) undo them.  Regardless, I would strongly recommend that 
the programs not be accessible by random people on the Internet.

Usage</A>
</H1>

<UL>
<LI>wt_display
	<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Adding an item</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The form supplies a mostly-blank form for adding new entries.
It supplies a default ``percent-complete'' value of 0 and a ``priority''
of 50.  You must type at least one character in the ``description''
field in order for the entry to be added.  Invalid characters in
either the priority or percent-complete field will also cause the
addition to fail. The priority and percent-complete fields must
be numbers between 0 and 100, inclusive.  The ``who'' field is
currently limited to 20 characters. The ``when'' field is currently
limited to 12 characters.  Click ``Add entry'' to add it when you're
ready. The fields in this area are not sticky like most fields
in CGI scripts - this is a feature. It makes adding new entries
easier by clearing out the old entry's information.

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Tweaking the filters</STRONG></DT>
<DD>There are three knobs you can twiddle: sorting, filtering on the
``who'' field, and deciding whether or not to display items that are 100% complete.

<P>
There are three ways to sort the entries: by weighted priority,
percent-complete, or priority.  A weighted-priority sort works by
multiplying an item's priority by how far it is from done 
(100 minus percent-complete).
This has the effect of pushing higher-priority, less-complete items
towards the top. Weighted-priority is the default sorting method.
Sorting by percent-complete
and priority are straightforward.  A checkbox lets you reverse the
sense of the sort.

<P>
If you're just interested in items which have a certain person
working on them, enter that name in the ``who'' filter. Leaving this
field blank will skip the name filtering. It is blank by default.

<P>
A checkbox exists to let you choose whether or not to display
completd items. Leaving this box unchecked reduces screen clutter. It is
unchecked by default.

<P>
After selecting the options you want (if they're different from
the defaults), click ``Redisplay entries'' to update the list.
The above options are sticky; that is, after selecting them and
clicking ``Redisplay'', the same options will be set. This is intentionally
different from the non-sticky behavior of the fields in the ``Add entry''
table above.

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>The entries</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Here, the entries are listed in a table according to the filters
set above.  Unexciting, except for the ``Id'' field, which contains
a hyperlink to the wt_edit script for that entry. Segue, anyone?
	</DD>
</DL>

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>wt_edit
	<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Percent-complete and Priority</STRONG></DT>
<DD>You may make changes to either of these fields.
	</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Description</STRONG></DT>
<DD>You cannot edit an entry's previous descriptions - they are
displayed above a text box where you can enter new information.
If you submit changes, the description field will automatically be populated
with any changes to the percent-complete or priority fields.
	</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Who and when fields</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The ``who'' and ``when'' fields, if they were previously blank, will now show
``&amp;nbsp;'' instead.  This is not a bug, but rather a work-around for
netscape's odd behavior when displaying blank information in a table.
If the field was /really/ blank, netscape stops drawing the table border
around the field; with the ``&amp;nbsp;'' in there, netscape will draw the
border and simply fill the field with a space. Using an actual space
doesn't work, unfortunately.
	</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Submit and Reset Values</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Clicking on ``Reset Values'' will take things back the way they were.
Clicking ``Submit'' will modify the entry.  Note that if any illegal values
for percent-complete or priority exist, the field will default back to its
previous value. After submitting the form, you are taken back to the main
wt_display page. There is also a hyperlink (``forget this!'') for it.
